### Abstract—
Climate change refers to significant and long-term
alterations in the Earth’s climate patterns, typically resulting
from human activities that increase greenhouse gas emissions.
Addressing climate change is not merely an option but a
necessity, demanding creative solutions and efforts from indi-
viduals, researchers, communities, and governments. Despite the
capabilities of machine learning (ML) with data-driven solutions
promising to combat climate change-related problems, they face
challenges stemming from traditional computational methods and
prolonged training times, impeding their practical utility. Recent
strides in quantum computing have permeated diverse domains,
spanning from manufacturing engineering and pharmaceutical
discovery to the latest frontier of detecting climate anomalies.
With the potential to substantially reduce time and computational
complexity, quantum computing shows promise in addressing
climate change impacts. Its distinctive features will enable the
concurrent exploration of expansive solution spaces, making it
well-suited for analyzing extensive climate datasets, simulating
intricate climate models, optimizing resource allocation, and
discerning patterns in climate data for mitigation and adaptation
endeavors. This study explores the potential of using Quantum
machine learning (QML) techniques on climate and weather
data obtained from NASA Giovannis. We used two QML al-
gorithms, the Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC) and
the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) models, using the
IBM Qiskit ML 0.7.2 ecosystem. We used an actual 127-Qubit
IBM Quantum Computer (IBM 127-qubit Eagle) in this study.
The methodology and results sections describe the experiences
gained from applying and evaluating quantum ML results on
climate and weather data obtained from NASA satellites as a
novel practical application of quantum computing.
